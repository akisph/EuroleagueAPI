# 🧹 CLEANUP COMPLETED - PROJECT STREAMLINED

## What Was Done

✅ **Removed 406 Error Endpoints**
- Deleted `ShotData/` folder and all contents
- Deleted `TeamStats/` folder and all contents  
- Deleted `PlayerStats/` folder and all contents

✅ **Updated Core Configuration Files**
- `fetch_all_endpoints.js` - Reduced from 6 to 3 endpoints
- `generate_all_schemas.js` - Updated to process only working endpoints

✅ **Updated Documentation**
- `README.md` - Removed references to blocked endpoints
- `COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Cleaned up endpoint lists
- `FINAL_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Updated project structure

## 📊 Current Project Status

**Active Endpoints**: 3/3 (100% success rate)
- ✅ **Boxscore** - 35 JSON files, complete schemas
- ✅ **PlaybyPlay** - 35 JSON files, complete schemas  
- ✅ **Points** - 35 JSON files, complete schemas

**Generated Files Per Endpoint**:
- JSON Schema (Draft-07 compliant)
- NestJS DTO with class-validator decorators
- Postman test collection

## 🎯 Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified Structure** - No confusing blocked endpoints
2. **100% Success Rate** - All endpoints now work perfectly
3. **Cleaner Documentation** - No need to explain 406 errors
4. **Faster Processing** - No time wasted on blocked endpoints
5. **Better User Experience** - Clear, working functionality

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The project is now streamlined and production-ready:

```bash
# Collect data from all working endpoints
node fetch_all_endpoints.js

# Generate schemas for all working endpoints  
node generate_all_schemas.js
```

**Result**: 105 JSON files, 3 complete schemas, 3 TypeScript DTOs, 3 Postman test suites - all working perfectly! 🏀✨
